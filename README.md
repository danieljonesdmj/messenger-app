# Meshenger

*Have you ever been at a festival, trying to message your friends, only to find the network is overloaded? With Meshenger, you have other options. With Meshenger, you're never out of reach. With Meshenger you could be having a pint with your friends right now.*

Meshenger is an iPhone based messaging service that allows registered users to chat to each other in different channels. It can even connect users when there is no internet connection available by allowing user to send messages over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct.  

Meshenger was built over two weeks at Makers Academy coding bootcamp by [Daniel Jones](https://github.com/danieljonesdmj), [Cornelis Heuperman](https://github.com/heuperman), [Yvonne Tang](https://github.com/YvCodeHong) and [Jay Khan](https://github.com/neobay991), none of which had ever made a mobile app before.
